      <p>Hi, I'm Joakim! <span class="emoji">🙋🏻‍♂️</span>I enjoy creating beautiful user experiences. I work as contract software developer across the whole stack. In my spare time hang out with my family, renovating our house and organize the sthlm.js user group.</p>
      <p>With 12 years of software development experience and a masters degree in computer science I know a thing or two about how to turn an idea into a tangible product. In the past I’ve worked with multiple startups and helped them grow.</p>
